# C - Debugging 

In this project, I learned about debugging, and some methods of debugging manually and also how to read error messages.


## Helper File :ledger:

* [0-main.c](./0-main.c): C function that prints if integer is positive or negative

## Header File :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project. 


| File                      | Prototype                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0-main.c`                | `void positive_or_negative(int i);`                       |
| `2-largest_number.c`      | `int largest_number(int a, int b, int c);`                |
| `3-print_remaining_days.c`| `void print_remaining_days(int month, int day, int year);`|
| `3-print_remaining_days.c`| `int convert_day(int month, int day);`                    |

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Multiple mains**
  * [0-main.c](./0-main.c): C program that tests the function `positive_or_negative()` and gives the correct output when given a case of `0`

* **1. Like, comment, subscribe**
  * [1-main.c](./1-main.c): C program that causes an output to go into an infinite loop.

* **2. 0> 972?**
  * [2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c): This program prints the largest of three integers.

* **3. Leap year**
  * [3-print_remaining_days.c](./3-print_remaining_days.c): This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
